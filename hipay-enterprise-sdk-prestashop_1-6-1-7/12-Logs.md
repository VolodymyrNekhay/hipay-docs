## Logs

HiPay logs all the necessary information if there is a problem with the module.
These logs will be requested by HiPay technical teams to solve your problem
as quickly as possible: they are saved in the PrestaShop log directory located in the  "_app / logs_" directory.

You will find different levels of logs in this interface:

- **Error logs**: All errors that occured on the HiPay Gateway
- **News logs**: Technical logs
- **Callback logs**: HiPay Gateway notifications
- **Request logs**: Calls to the HiPay Gateway

We invite you to keep these files and set up a [**log rotation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_rotation)  with your web host.
