# Unit tests

Unit tests are included as part of the demo app. If you want to run the unit tests, you first need to install the demo app by following this guide: [Testing the demo app](#testing-the-demo-app).

When the project is opened in Xcode, make sure that the `HiPayEnterprise-Example` target is selected.

Finally, click on *Product* and *Test* to run the unit tests.
