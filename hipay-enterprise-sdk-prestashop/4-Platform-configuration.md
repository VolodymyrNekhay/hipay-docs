# Platform configuration

## Allow the IP addresses of your servers

When a request is sent to the HiPay Fullservice servers, the IP address or IP address range from where the connection was made is verified. If it matches with the IP address previously provided by the merchant, the request will be processed. In case of missing or incorrect information, the server will respond with an appropriate error message, indicating the error in the request.

To do this, you must log in your HiPay Fullservice back office (https://merchant.hipay-tpp.com), click on the "_Integration_" tab, then on "_Security Settings_" and enter your IP address(es) in the "_IP Restriction_" section.

> **Important!**
>
> When changing your IP addresses, make sure that all the new ones are configured for your account. If not, your server requests will be rejected.

- Pending Page:   http://www.{your-domain.com}?controller=pending
- Cancel Page:    http://www.{your-domain.com}?controller=cancel

Click on the "_Integration_" tab, then on "_Notifications_"

Donâ€™t forget to replace {your-domain.com} by your own domain.
