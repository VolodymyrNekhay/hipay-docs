#Introduction

In this document we describe the method to parameter and use the HiPay Fullservice TPP module for Magento webshop.

##To know

-   You will need to configure your HiPay Fullservice TPP account before
    installing your Magento module under HiPay Fullservice TPP back
    office
    ([*https://merchant.hipay-tpp.com/*](https://merchant.hipay-tpp.com/)).
-   HiPay Fullservice TPP module is not offered natively on Magento, you
    must contact HiPay to get the module.
-   This module needs valid HiPay Fullservice TPP credentials to use it,
    please contact HiPay to get them.


#Platform Configuration

##Allow your servers IP addresses

When a request is sent to the HiPay Fullservice TPP servers, the IP
address or IP address range from where the connection was made is
verified. If it matches with the IP address supplied by the Merchant at
a previous stage, the request will be processed. In the case of missing
or incorrect information, the server will respond with an appropriate
error message, indicating the error in the request.

To do this, you must log in your HiPay Fullservice TPP back office
(https://merchant.hipay-tpp.com), click on the "*Integration*" menu,
then "*Security Setting*" and enter your IP(s) in "*IP restriction*"
section.

![Important](images/media/image5.png)
<br/>**Important!**

When changing your IP address, do not forget to ensure that all new IP addresses are configured for your account. If not, your server requests will be rejected.
  
![ip](images/media/image6.png)

##Choose a passphrase

It is strongly recommended that you use a signature mechanism to verify
the contents of a request or redirection made to your servers. This will
prevent customers from tampering with the data in the data exchanges
between your servers and our payment system.

A unique signature is sent each time that HiPay contact a merchant URL,
notification or redirection.

First of all you will need to set a Secret Passphrase in your HiPay
Fullservice TPP back office under “*Integration -&gt; Security Settings -&gt; Secret Passphrase*”.

![passphrase](images/media/image7.jpg)

##Configure redirection URLs

To use the HiPay Fullservice TPP module, you need to configure the
redirection URLs in your HiPay Fullservice TPP back office under
“*Integration -&gt; Redirect Pages*”.

-   Accept Page: `http://www.{your-domain.com}/index.php/hipay/cc/accept/`
-   Decline Page: `http://www.{your-domain.com}/index.php/hipay/cc/decline/`
-   Pending Page: `http://www.{your-domain.com}/index.php/hipay/cc/pending/`
-   Cancel Page: `http://www.{your-domain.com}/index.php/hipay/cc/cancel/`
-   Exception Page: `Empty`

Then click on "*Integration*" menu, then "*Notifications*"

-   Notification URL: http://www.{your-domain.com}/index.php/hipay/notify/index

#Payment configuration

##“Sale” mode

When making a purchase with the “sale” method, the capture is requested
just after the authorization automatically. *Please refer to
“HiPayTPP-GatewayAPI documentation, chapter 3.1 Request a New Order –
operation”*

If the payment fails, the customer is redirected to the error page and
the status is defined like configured in the module configuration.

If successful, the customer is redirected to the success page, the
invoice is created if the configuration allows it and the status is
defined like this:

-   “capture_waiting”
-   “processing”

##“Authorization” mode 

When making a purchase with the "Authorization" mode, the transaction
will be on “waiting capture”. *Please refer to “HiPayTPP-GatewayAPI
documentation, chapter 3.1 Request a New Order – operation”*

The customer is not charged directly: You have 7 days to "capture" this
order to charge the customer. Otherwise the order will be cancelled.

If the payment fails, the customer is redirected to the error page and
the status is defined like configured in the module configuration.

If successful, the customer is redirected to the success page. At this
time the order status is “*Waiting for capture*” Once you’re ready to
capture the transaction:

-   If the configuration does not allow the creation of invoice, you
    must create the invoice from the order overview. You can click on
    “*Capture online*” This will send the capture information on the
    TPP server. If successful, the invoice is created. The payment is
    captured and you can create your shipment.
-   If the configuration allows the creation of invoice, click on the
    invoice and on “*capture”* button. This will send the capture
    information to HiPay Fullservice TPP server. If successful, the
    invoice status changes to “*Paid*”.

You can also do the “*capture*” directly on your HiPay Fullservice TPP
BackOffice. The invoice will be created automatically on your Magento
BackOffice.

##Refund

HiPay Fullservice TPP allows a refund online. To do this, simply create
a "*Credit memo*" on the Invoice (not from the order).

![refund](images/media/image12.png)
You will have two options: “*Refund Offline*" (we are not interested in
our case) or the "*Refund*".

Choose the amount and click on “*Refund*”. If successful, the credit
memo is created and the refund is validated.

##Oneclick (only available for credit-card payment methods) 

If the OneClick option is activated it will let your system create an
“*alias*” of the credit card. This will let the customer use a saved
credit card in his second transaction and he will no need to refill all
the payment data.

This option will be available only if the customer has created an
account in your site.

##MO/TO Payment (please contact HiPay to create a MO/TO account)

If merchant needs to create a new order and pay it using customers’
financial details received over the phone he can follow this
instructions:

	- “*System -&gt; Manage Stores -&gt; Create Store View*”

        View and follow Chapter 4 with your MO/TO account credentials.

    1.  Add your products, Account information, Billing address,
