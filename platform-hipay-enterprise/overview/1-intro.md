# HiPay Fullservice Platform Overview

# About this Guide 

## Purpose

This document is designed to provide you with details on how to integrate your business with the HiPay Fullservice payment gateway. This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to simply and quickly get up and running with our services as well as detailed reference material.

Where applicable, this document refers to the related documentation with further details.

## Intended Audience

The intended audience is the merchant's technical staff or the
merchant's system integrator.

Because almost all communication between the merchant's system and the
REST API is realized through predefined XML or JSON messages over the
Internet using standard protocols, you will need basic XML/JSON
programming skills and knowledge of HTTP(S). Furthermore, it is
recommended that you are familiar with the basics of tokenization
concepts.

# Acronyms and Abbreviations

The following acronyms and abbreviations are used in this guide.

| Acronym   |      Full Name    |
|----------|:-------------:|
| BIN |  Bank Identification Number
| PAN |  Primary Account Number
| PCI DSS |  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards
| REST |  Representational State Transfer
| SDK |  Software development kit

# Technical integration

In order for you to accept payment through the HiPay Fullservice platform, you need to integrate our APIs. HiPay proposes a wide variety of turnkey integrations for industry-standard e-commerce platforms and other SDKs and libraries. **[You can find all the HiPay Fullservice integrations here.](/fullservice)**

You may also integrate our REST API if you have specific technical needs. To this end, please check the next chapter of this guide: *API Overview*.

# API Overview

The APIs are based on REST principles. Thus, it is very easy to write and test applications.

HiPay Fullservice exposes three main APIs, allowing you **manage payment data**, **get paid** and dealing you **finance operations**. The detailed documentation and reference of these APIs, including web service URLs and parameter information, are provided in interactive documentation tools, see below for more information.

## Gateway API

The Gateway API allows you to get paid and manage orders and transactions. By leveraging this API, you will be able to present payment pages to your customer.

**[Click here to access the full interactive documentation and live testing tools of the HiPay Fullservice Gateway API](/doc-api/fullservice/gateway/).**

## Tokenization API

The Tokenization (Secure Vault) API allows merchants to retrieve and update data associated with their customers' payment information stored in the HiPay Fullservice Secure Vault. Using the Tokenization API, merchants eliminate the risk, liability and cost of storing sensitive data on their local servers and storage devices. The Tokenization API aims to be used alongside the Gateway API. 

**[Click here to access the full interactive documentation and live testing tools of the HiPay Fullservice Tokenization API](/doc-api/fullservice/token/).**

## Finance API

When using HiPay Fullservice, all your sales are consolidated and settled (transferred to your bank account). The Finance API allows you to get all the details about settlements executed for your merchant account.

**[Click here to access the full interactive documentation and live testing tools of the HiPay Fullservice Finance API](/doc-api/fullservice/settlement/).**

# Security Considerations

The HiPay Fullservice platform is protected:

-   To ensure that only authorized merchants use it,
-   To prevent payment information from being compromised.

## PCI DSS Requirements

**Description**:
HiPay Fullservice allows sending payment data, that means that the system will be transmitting, and possibly storing card data.

**Storage (SAD) information**:
The Card Schemes, American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa Inc. have never permitted the storage of sensitive data (track data and/or CVV2). It is prohibited under "Requirement 3" of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

**Warning**:
Merchants who store Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD) are exposed to fines from the Card Schemes.

**Security management data**: If the Tokenization API is used, the merchant demonstrates that the system can handle this data securely and that he is taking full responsibility for his PCI DSS compliance.

**Contact**
For further information on PCI security standards, please visit [www.pcisecuritystandards.org](www.pcisecuritystandards.org).

## Encrypted Communication

**Description**: HiPay Fullservice provides all REST API methods over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

**Guarantees**: All data transmitted between HiPay Fullservice and the Merchant system is encrypted (256-bit encryption using a DigiCert certificate).

## IP Restriction

**Description**: When a request is sent to the platform, the IP address or IP address range from where the connection was made is verified.

If it matches with the IP address supplied by the Merchant at a previous stage (in the Merchant Interface: Technical Integration Section), the request will be processed.

In the case of missing or incorrect information, the server will respond with an appropriate error message, indicating the error in the request.

**Important**: When your IP address is changed, do not forget to ensure that all new IP addresses are configured for your account. If not, your server requests will be rejected.
  
## Authentication

Only authenticated users and system components are allowed to access to the Secure Gateway API.

# 3-D Secure Integration

## Introduction

**Overview**: This chapter describes how you should implement 3-D Secure Authentication.

**Description**: This process involves redirecting the shopper to an authentication page. This page is provided and hosted by the shopper's Card Issuer. As this page is hosted by the shopper’s card issuing bank, we have no control over its appearance or functionality.

## About 3-D Secure

**3-D Secure History**: In early 2001, VISA introduced a security protocol called 3-D Secure to improve online transaction performance and to accelerate the growth of electronic commerce through increased consumer confidence. 

**Objective of 3-D Secure**: The objective of 3-D Secure was to provide Issuers with the ability to actually authenticate cardholders during an online purchase, to reduce the likelihood of fraudulent usage of payment cards and to improve transaction performance to benefit merchants, consumers and acquirers.
VISA’s branded 3-D Secure Program is commonly known as Verified By VISA (VbV). Services based on the protocol have been also been adopted by MasterCard, under the name MasterCard SecureCode™ (MSC).

## Merchant Benefits

**3-D Secure Benefits**: The benefits of the 3-D Secure Process are the enhanced security available when performing an authenticated transaction as well as the shift of liability in the event of fraudulent transactions. Authentication should strengthen your existing anti-fraud strategy and help protect your business, but bare in mind that coverage of authentication programs is currently limited to Internet transactions. 

**Restriction**: This means that authentication programs do not cover fax, mail, or phone orders (MO/TO), nor do they cover all card types.The additional security benefits and liability shifts of authenticated transactions are currently only supported by Visa and MasterCard.

## Transaction Flow

### Procedure

Proceed as follow to carry out a transaction:

1. Merchant calls the HiPay Fullservice API with the `authentication_indicator` value of `1` or `2` (or the Fraud Protection System (FPS) system asks for 3-D Secure).
2. To complete the purchase; the cardholder clicks the **Pay** button after filling payment card details in payment page: This activates the Merchant Plug-In (MPI) and initiates a transaction.    
3. The MPI identifies the card number and sends it to the Directory Server to determine whether the card is in a participating card range.
4. If the Issuer is participating for the card range, the Directory sends a Verify Enrollment Request message to the Issuer *ACS* to determine whether authentication is available for the account number.
5. The *ACS* returns a Verify Enrollment Response to the Directory Server 
	- If authentication is available for this card number, then the response provides the URL of the *ACS* where the cardholder can be authenticated.
If the payment is in a hosted payment page, the redirection to *ACS* will be done automatically.
	- If authentication is not available, then the HiPay server receives a *Cardholder Not Enrolled* or *Authentication Not Available* message and proceeds depending on `authentication_indicator` value:
		- `1`: Proceed with a standard transaction processing (skip to step 13).
		- `2`: Transaction is refused.
6. The Directory Server forwards the *ACS* response to the MPI.
7. The MPI sends an Authentication Request message to the cardholder’s browser for routing to the *ACS*.
8. The cardholder’s browser passes the Authentication Request to the *ACS*.
9. The *ACS* authenticates the cardholder.
10. The *ACS* creates, digitally signs, and sends an *Authentication Response* to HiPay via the cardholder’s browser. The *ACS* also sends transaction record to the Authentication History Server for storage.
11. The browser routes the Authentication Response back to the MPI.
12. The MPI validates the digital signature in the response, verifying that it is from a valid participating Issuer.
13. HiPay formats and sends to its Acquirer an Authorization Request message, which includes information from the Issuer’s Authentication Response — including the CVV and the ECI. The Acquirer passes the Authorization Request to the Card Network and the transaction completes through standard processing.
14. HiPay sends a notification with transaction status and 3-D Secure authentication result. *Refer to Authentication Results section*.

### Workflow overview

![3-D Secure transaction workflow overview](images/media/image1.png)

## Authentication Results

The following table lists the enrollment message and status:

| Status   | Enrollment Message | 3-D Secure Available? | ECI | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|----------|:-------------:|----------|:-------------:|
| `Y` | Authentication Available | Yes | - | Card is enrolled in the 3-D Secure program and the payer is eligible for authentication processing.
| `N` | Cardholder Not Enrolled | No | `6` | Card is not enrolled in 3-D Secure program. **Chargeback Liability Shift**: If the cardholder later disputes the purchase, the issuer may not submit a chargeback to the merchant.
| `U` | Unable to Authenticate | No | `7` | The card associations were unable to verify if the cardholder is enrolled in the 3-D Secure program. Merchants can choose to accept the card nonetheless and proceed the purchase as non-authenticated when submitting the authorization. **Chargeback Liability Shift**: The Acquirer/Merchant retains liability if the cardholder later disputes making the purchase.
| `E` | Any error message here | No | `7` | An error occurred during the enrollment verification process. **Chargeback Liability Shift**: The card can be accepted for authorization processing, yet the merchant may not claim a liability shift on this transaction in case of a dispute with the cardholder.

The following table lists the Authentication message and status:

| Status   | Authentication Message | ECI | Description |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `Y` | Authentication Successful | `5` | Cardholder was successfully authenticated.The Issuer has authenticated the cardholder by verifying the identity information or password.
| `A` | Authentication Attempted | `6` | Authentication could not be performed but a proof of authentication attempt was provided.
| `U` | Authentication Could Not Be Performed | `7` | The Issuer is not able to complete the authentication request due to a technical error or other problem. Possible reasons include:Invalid type of card such as a Commercial Card or any anonymous Prepaid Card.Unable to establish an SSL session with cardholder browser.
| `N` | Authentication Failed | - | The cardholder did not complete authentication and the card should not be accepted for payment. The following are reasons to fail an authentication: Cardholder fails to correctly enter the authentication information; Cardholder cancels the authentication process. An authentication failure may be a possible indication of a fraudulent user. **Authorization request should not be submitted.**
| `E` | Any error message here | - | An error occurred during the authentication process. **Authorization request should not be submitted.**

# Redirect Pages

## Redirect your customer to a page of your choice

**Description**: The redirect pages are pages to which HiPay Fullservice redirects your customer's browser after the transaction is processed if it was made out of your website (hosted payment page, local payments, 3-D Secure authentication, etc.).

**Objective**: Typically, this is a secure page on your site. The main purpose is to redirect your customers back to your website once they have completed a payment.

## Redirect pages setup

**Description**: You can find redirect pages configuration over *Integration -> Redirect Pages* on your HiPay Fullservice back office.
                
You can overwrite the default redirect pages by sending custom URLs along with the order details in your requests to the payment gateway. Please refer to the [HiPay Fullservice Gateway API documentation](/doc-api/fullservice/gateway/).

## Default redirect pages
  
| Field Name   |      Description    |
|----------|-------------|
| Accept page |  Page to redirect your customer if transaction was successful.
| Decline page |  Page to redirect your customer if transaction was refused.
| Pending page |  Page to redirect your customer if transaction is pending.
| Cancel page |  Page to redirect your customer if transaction was cancelled.
| Exception page |  Page to which the customer's browser is redirected after a system failure or when the payment gateway is temporarily unavailable. If page is not defined, the default page for exceptions is displayed by the payment gateway.

## Feedback Parameters

**Description**: Select this option in your HiPay Fullservice back office if you want that HiPay Fullservice sends back the transaction parameters to your redirect pages for further processing within your own website.

**Procedure**: To activate this option you “MUST” specify at least an “Accept Page” URL. Sent parameters are included in your redirect pages on HTTP GET.

## Transaction Workflow

**Description**: The HiPay Fullservice payment gateway can process transactions through many different acquirers using different payment methods and involving some anti-fraud checks. All these aspects change the transaction processing flow significantly for you.

When you activate a server-to-server notification on HiPay Fullservice, you receive a response describing the transaction state. Depending on the transaction state there are five options to action:

| Transaction state   |      Description    |
|----------|-------------|
| completed |  If the transaction state is completed you are done. This is the most common case for credit card transaction processing. Almost all credit card acquirers works in that way. Then you have to look into the status field of the response to know the exact transaction status.
| pending |  Transaction request was submitted to the acquirer but response is not yet available.
| declined |  Transaction was processed and was declined by gateway.
| error |  Transaction was not processed due to some reasons.

#Signature verification

## Introduction

**Directive**: It is strongly recommended to use a signature mechanism to verify the contents of a request or redirection made to your servers. This prevents customers from tampering with the data in the data exchanges between your servers and our payment system.

A unique signature is sent each time that HiPay contact any merchant URL, notification or redirection.
        
## Setup

First of all you need to set a Secret Passphrase in your HiPay Fullservice back office under “*Integration -> Security Settings -> Secret Passphrase*”.

![](images/media/image3.jpeg)

**Secret passphrase**: The secret passphrase is used to generate a unique character string (signature) hashed with SHA algorithm. The security level of the password depends on the length of the password. A long password is more secured.

## Verification

**URL Notification**: For the URL notification, the signature is sent on the HTTP header under the `HTTP_X_ALLOPASS_SIGNATURE` parameter. To check this point, you just need to concatenate the passphrase with the POST content of the query. Algorithm: SHA Signature = SHA1(Raw POST Data + Secret Passphrase)

**URL Redirection**: For each redirection page (accept page, decline page, etc.) the signature is sent under the “hash” parameter. To check this point, you must concatenate the parameters, the values of each and the passphrase under the following conditions:
1. The parameter must be predefined.
2. The value can’t be empty.
3. The parameter must be sorted in alphabetical order.

- Algorithm:	- a.	paramC = val3
	- paramA = val1
	- paramB = val2
	- SHA Signature = `SHA1(paramAval1<passphrase>paramBval2<passphrase>paramCval3<passphrase>)`

*PHP Signature Validation*:

```php
   	$secretPassphrase = 'mypassphrasse';       	
   	//Secret Passphrase 
   	$string2compute = '';
   	
   	if (isset($_GET['hash'])) {   		
   		// If is a redirection URL
   		$signature = $_GET['hash'];
   		$parameters = $_GET;
   		unset($parameters['hash']);
   		ksort($parameters);
   		foreach ($parameters as $name => $value) {
   			if (strlen($value)>0) {
   		    		$string2compute .= $name . $value . $secretPassphrase;
   			}
   		}
   	}
   	else {				
   		// If is a Notification
   		$signature = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_ALLOPASS_SIGNATURE'];
   		$string2compute = $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA . $secretPassphrase;
   	}
   	$computedSignature = sha1($string2compute);
   	
   	// true if OK, false if not
   	if ($computedSignature == $signature) {
   	    $message = 'OK';
   	}
   	else {
   	    $message = 'KO';27   	}
```

#Device Fingerprint Integration

## Overview

The device fingerprint identifies devices through information collected by a client run on an end user’s computer. This client generates a black box that contains all device information available.

Web applications obtain device information by sourcing dynamically generated JavaScript from HiPay Fullservice. The JavaScript determines what information is available and generates a black box from all available sources.

A black box will typically:

- Range up to 4,000 bytes (the average length being just under 1,000 bytes)
- Contain alphanumeric values and the special characters: + / ; =
- Begin with 0200, 0400, 0500 or 0600

## Generate black box content
To integrate the client you must specify a hidden field that the JavaScript will populate. This adds the black box as another field to be submitted along the other details in the form.

**You MUST :**

1.	Include a hidden form field with an ID “ioBB” that will be populated with the value.
2.	Call the HiPay Fullservice fingerprint JavaScript function to obtain the black box content: https://secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/gateway/toolbox/fingerprint

**You MUST NOT**

1.	DO NOT call HiPay Fullservice fingerprint JavaScript BEFORE including the hidden “ioBB” form field.
2.	DO NOT cache or use local copies of the JavaScript (JavaScript is dynamically generated for each customer and so caching of the script may cause unrelated devices to be identified as the same computer. The script also uses domain cookies to identify devices across subscribers.) 

#Settlements

| `iban` | `DE23100000001234567890`
| `bank_name` | `Deutsche Bank`

##Recurring payment response

See below the received response. Please pay attention to the field `debit_agreement_id`, which is the most important here.

Merchants must save its value to make more transactions on the same
mandate.

##Response in XML format using Order service

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    		<id>574</id>
    		<status>available</status>
  	</debit_agreement>

```



##Response in XML format using Hpayment service

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<response>  
	<forward_url>https://stage-secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/payment/web/pay/12...55</forward_url>
  	<test>true</test>

  	. . .
  	<order>
    		<id>5630ccbe32951</id>
    		<date_created>2015-10-28T13:30:47+0000</date_created>
    		<attempts>0</attempts>
    		<amount>113.25</amount>
    		<shipping>4.50</shipping>
    		<tax>0.50</tax>
    		<decimals>2</decimals>
    		<currency>EUR</currency>
    		<customer_id>test</customer_id>
    		<language>fr_FR</language>
    		<email>test@hipay.com</email>
  	</order>
</response>
```

At this point, the transaction status is `Authentication requested`. The merchant will redirect the customer to the HiPay payment page, which will redirect him or her to the pay4 payment page to complete the registration, as shown here.

![](images/media/image6.png) 

After completing the registration, the customer is redirected to the success page specified by the merchant in the initial payment request (or to the error page in case of failure).
                                                                                                                             
The transaction status will change to `Authenticated`, then to `Authorization requested`. A few days later (approximately 5 bank working days), the transaction status will change from `Authorization requested` to `Captured` directly (due to the lack of information about the status change between the transmission and the receipt of the payment).

##Notification response in XML format

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<notification>

  </debit_agreement>
</notification>
```


#Initiating a transaction on an existing mandate

When a merchant wants to make a payment on an existing mandate, the bank
account owner doesn’t need to be present.

To proceed, the merchant has to send the value of the aforementioned
field `debit_agreement_id` to HiPay.

##Specific required fields:

| Parameter name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| payment_product | `sdd`
| eci | `9` (recurring e-commerce)
| debit_agreement_id | `574` (example)
| recurring_payment | `1`


##Response

See below the received response. This time, the transaction status is
set to `Authorization requested` directly, as a confirmation is not
required to make another payment on an existing mandate.

###Response in XML format
